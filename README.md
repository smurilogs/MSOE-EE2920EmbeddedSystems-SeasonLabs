# MSOE | EE2920 Embedded Systems Labs

### About the Project

This repo brings up an introductory series of implementations on how to design Embedded Systems using the ATmega328P microcontrollers at the registers level and C programming language. This is a brief recover on the concepts of a course called EE2920 Embedded Systems, taken by me as international student back in the Fall of 2014 at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE).

The main idea of the course was to introduce general concepts on how to tame the design of Embedded Systems using main resources available in modern microcontrollers using C/C++ Programmig Language. For this course, the microcontroller used was the ATmega328P, famous to compose Arduino boards such as Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano. However the concepts covered help you to understand the general working of many modern microcontrollers. 

Built with:

* C/C++ Programming Language
* ATmega328P (you can use Arduino Uno/Nano boards)
* Sensors and actuators specified in each lab README file

### Table of Contents

The series requirements and content is shown in detail by the README file of each lab. The following content topics present each lab's title to present to you a general idea of what it approached in this serie: 

* Lab 1: Blinking LED
* Lab 2: Bouncing LEDs
* Lab 3: LCD and Switch Debouncing
* Lab 4: Digital Line Sensor Array
* Lab 5: Analog-to-Digital Conversion
* Lab 6: A/D Conversion, Interrupts and Analog Sensors
* Lab 7: Waveform Generation (using the Timers and Interrupts)
* Lab 8: Infrared Object Sensing
* Lab 9: Servo Motor Control
